                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello! My name is Joseph McDonald, I am a student at Seneca College in the Computer Science and Analysis program.
                    I have strived to engage with a wide breadth of topics in my field, and have experience coding in C, C++, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
                    Additionally, I have prior work experience in the use of AutoCAD software for drafting in the construction industry.

            <h2>On WEB222</h2>
            <p>All of the know-how for the creation of this webpage came from Seneca College's WEB222 program,
                which teaches the basics of JavaScript, <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. By teaching all three topics in the same course,
                students gain an understanding of the basics of creating responsive webpages, laying the groundwork
                for learning more complex web design philosophies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although initially daunting, I found that learning all three coding languages in the same course greatly improved my understanding
                of how web pages function. With only one language, any sort of modern web design would be incomplete;
                with HTML being required to structure the page, JavaScript to make the page responsive for the user, and CSS to make
                the page visually appealing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Topics uder the HTML portion of the course covered structuring the page with many of the commonly used tags, a full introduction to working with the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>,
                as well as linking HTML events to JavaScript code to create responsive webpages. In order to create a responsive webpage, JavaScript was used to store and work with data through classes and arrays,
                perform data validation with Regular Expressions, and create functions that interact with members of the DOM tree to create Forms.
                CSS was introduced later in the course to improve the visuals of the HTML pages with many of the commonly used and popular CSS libraries.        
            </p>
            <p>Tackling cumulative topics in Workshops, with each resulting in a working webpage, helped to build my ability to code
                at a manageable pace throughout the semester. I'd highly recommend this approach to learning web design to new students,
                as it can produce immediate results that can be put to use.
            </p>
            <p>I hope to apply what I have learned to work in the web design industry, pushing the limits of my creative work with the languages,
                and further my learning at Seneca as I continue in WEB322 in the upcoming semester.
